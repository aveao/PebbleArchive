One day I thought about how these numbers would look, if seen through a perforated metal plate. Its holes would have a different visual density depending on how much lines meet underneath. This is where the idea for Digital Density was born.\r\n\r\nThe numbers are made of six dots at maximum. The dots are where the segments of the classic numbers have their ends. Sometimes three classic number segments meet in a spot, the visual density is high there. This situation has been transformed to a big dot for the new numbers. If two classic number segments would meet, the density is medium and so the resulting dot is medium. A single line results in a small dot. No line - no dot at all. So the new dot numbers have the same visual density as the classic numbers but have a more abstract appearance. They look weird at first, but they share a certain resemblance with their archetypes. There are four numbers aligned in a 2x2 array. The top ones tell the hours, the bottom ones tell the minutes. The Pebble Time fits nicely to these numbers with its round and simple case.\r\n\r\nThe red watchface has been made especially for the red Pebble Time. \r\n\r\nDesign : Sam Jerichow Programming : Sam Jerichow with kind support from Nev Rawlins\r\nCopyright \u00a9 2012, 2015 Sam Jerichow", "developer_id": "54ed03c2d9c53b312f00010f", "header_images": "", "hearts": 28, "id": "556612a66ad391cc81000096", "latest_release": {"id": "55661529f1a1c7687700008a", "js_version": -1, "pbw_file": "https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/pYhkASSSTySDW7eqtUKC", "published_date": "2015-05-28T16:46:59.986Z", "release_notes": "", "version": "1.0"}, "links": {"add": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/556612a66ad391cc81000096/add", "remove": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/556612a66ad391cc81000096/remove", "add_heart": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/556612a66ad391cc81000096/add_heart", "remove_heart": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/556612a66ad391cc81000096/remove_heart", "add_flag": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/556612a66ad391cc81000096/flags/add", "remove_flag": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/556612a66ad391cc81000096/flags/remove", "share": "https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/556612a66ad391cc81000096"}, "list_image": {"80x80": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/JJfVO3AATmmczQqVIkxK/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80", "144x144": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/JJfVO3AATmmczQqVIkxK/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"}, "published_date": "2015-05-28T16:47:09.434Z", "screenshot_hardware": "basalt", "screenshot_images": [{"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/JJfVO3AATmmczQqVIkxK/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}, {"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/SWZsoKcCTIuug9EYOBIx/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}, {"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2Zle7W9HRpmn4vGgYBr6/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}, {"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/NtLJKIHdRqulvY5rlQ6m/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}, {"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/dvNVHRr3RaaOZL7yUfaw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}], "source": "", "title": "Digital Density R", "type": "watchface", "uuid": "5835c18b-35f4-452a-83e7-0a9b6fabbc8e", "website": ""}
