The game\u2019s smartly designed to ensure that each level is a puzzle in itself. With just 10 seconds (maximum) to destroy all enemies, players will need to combine brain with throwing stars in order to meet each level\u2019s objectives, with lightning-fast reactions required to be rewarded with a perfect score.\r\n\r\n10 Second Ninja X boasts 100 immaculately designed levels. Whilst much of the challenge comes from demonstrating the dexterity and reactions necessary to traverse each level \u2013 players with real skill will want to complete each quickly. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s out now on PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Vita.\r\nwww.10second.ninja\r\n\r\n \r\nInstructions: \r\n\r\nShake wrist to start timer\r\nShake wrist to stop. \r\n\r\nUp button - about the game\r\nMiddle button - retrieve prize if you've won it already\r\nDown button - further information", "developer_id": "52ae3d0b935fa8ddcc00001e", "header_images": [{"orig": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/1vus2E53RrG9I8b7u8Rh/convert?cache=true&fit=crop", "720x320": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/1vus2E53RrG9I8b7u8Rh/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}], "hearts": 22, "icon_image": {"28x28": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/iH0hj3goRse1cikeHJPl/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28", "48x48": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/iH0hj3goRse1cikeHJPl/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"}, "id": "5767bcee0cc8f53b43000347", "latest_release": {"id": "578b27ff84accc5dac0001f7", "js_md5": "6c3d7ed6b2ac14fc26fd8af6ff7687ea", "js_version": -1, "pbw_file": "https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/T32LQ2NRGa9WWHEg9ByA", "published_date": "2016-07-17T07:57:16.005Z", "release_notes": "", "version": "1.0"}, "links": {"add": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5767bcee0cc8f53b43000347/add", "remove": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5767bcee0cc8f53b43000347/remove", "add_heart": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5767bcee0cc8f53b43000347/add_heart", "remove_heart": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5767bcee0cc8f53b43000347/remove_heart", "add_flag": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5767bcee0cc8f53b43000347/flags/add", "remove_flag": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5767bcee0cc8f53b43000347/flags/remove", "share": "https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5767bcee0cc8f53b43000347"}, "list_image": {"80x80": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/7FGBiHJ0SQynWcYKLcaa/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80", "144x144": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/7FGBiHJ0SQynWcYKLcaa/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"}, "published_date": "2016-07-19T08:55:32.422Z", "screenshot_hardware": "basalt", "screenshot_images": [{"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2XPaA1GTDyBkLp8QhI1F/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}], "source": "", "title": "10 Second Ninja X Challenge", "type": "watchapp", "uuid": "733b0c93-fc4b-4b49-9724-2d402aaf7ad9", "website": "http://www.10second.ninja/"}
