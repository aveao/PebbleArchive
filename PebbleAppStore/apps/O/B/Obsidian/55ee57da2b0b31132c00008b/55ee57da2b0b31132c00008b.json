It's designed such that the watch hands never cover the date or weather information.  It's main features are:\r\n\r\n- High contrast colors, clearly visible in most light conditions.\r\n- Display of the current date (day and month) as well as day of the week.\r\n- The date display is never obstructed by the watch hands.  If they would cover the date, the date moves slightly to the side.\r\n- Display the current weather information (icon and temperature). Just like the date, this information is never obstructed.\r\n- Weather information in Celcius or Fahrentheit. Weather information source is configurable to use openweathermap.org, darksky.net, or wunderground.com.\r\n- Weather is displayed for the current location by default, but it is possible to set a fixed location.\r\n- Display of the battery level.\r\n- Change in background for low battery levels (yellow at 30%, orange at 20%, and red at 10%).\r\n- Vibrates when the bluetooth connection is lost or regained, shows an information overlay for a few seconds and keeps showing an icon when no connection is available.\r\n- Fully configurable, both in terms of appearance (colors, minute/hour ticks, etc.) as well as behavior (if and when to vibrate, show messages, etc.).\r\n- Square or round version.\r\n- Supports Timeline Quick View.", "developer_id": "55ab3ca04f0cf8279e00003c", "header_images": "", "hearts": 414, "id": "55ee57da2b0b31132c00008b", "latest_release": {"id": "5841be93ca3094ca29000103", "js_md5": "711b3277b8440d86d02a3a5f72b5ff40", "js_version": -1, "pbw_file": "https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/K4CVpffSN2t1o50h3vsw", "published_date": "2016-12-02T18:34:17.721Z", "release_notes": "- Use temperature, not apparent temperature for darksky weather.\r\n- Respect quiet time.", "version": "3.3"}, "links": {"add": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ee57da2b0b31132c00008b/add", "remove": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ee57da2b0b31132c00008b/remove", "add_heart": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ee57da2b0b31132c00008b/add_heart", "remove_heart": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ee57da2b0b31132c00008b/remove_heart", "add_flag": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ee57da2b0b31132c00008b/flags/add", "remove_flag": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ee57da2b0b31132c00008b/flags/remove", "share": "https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55ee57da2b0b31132c00008b"}, "list_image": {"80x80": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/OY91vtsQeaTMF7VNklI2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80", "144x144": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/OY91vtsQeaTMF7VNklI2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"}, "published_date": "2015-09-08T08:19:44.475Z", "screenshot_hardware": "basalt", "screenshot_images": [{"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/OY91vtsQeaTMF7VNklI2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}, {"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/7smNdOMIQB2pIxEN3O0C/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}, {"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/kxrP12dRienginghdKwu/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}, {"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2k56UEeIRaCvej5fomMf/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}, {"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MuJ8uEsSdGsfyBzyWLWQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}], "source": "https://github.com/stefanheule/obsidian", "title": "Obsidian", "type": "watchface", "uuid": "ef42caba-0c65-4879-ab23-edd2bde68824", "website": ""}
