The face is elegant but practical with easy to read text. From top to bottom are an activity monitor, the daily steps, date, time, weather, battery percent and distance walked.\r\n\r\nConfiguration options include:\r\nDate in WDay, Month Day or WDay, Day Month\r\nTime in 12 or 24 hr Format\r\nTemperature in Celcius or Fahrenheit\r\nDistance in Kilometers or Miles\r\nDaily steps goal (6000 is the default, 0 turns it off).\r\nColors\r\n\r\nWhen bluetooth disconnects a red icon appears in the upper right.\r\n\r\nThe battery line changes color based on the percent left (green, yellow, red).\r\n\r\nThe activity monitor appears in the upper left.\r\nred Z = not nearly enough steps (not active)\r\norange x = a little movement but still not enough\r\n(blank) = normal activity (you could reach your goal if you sustained this level of activity)\r\ngreen a = active (pat yourself on the back)\r\ncyan A = more active (woo!)\r\nwhite ! = even more active (nosebleed!)\r\nActivity is based on steps goal (6000 is the default) over a 10 hour period or 50 steps every 5 minutes.  Less than 50 steps every five minutes will show a Z.  The idea is that if you see a red Z, you should get up and walk around.  Activity data is based only on the past hour (So previous hours from the past hour do not count. So each hour you have to get up and move even if you did a lot of steps in a previous hour.  Even if you reach your goal early, you still have to move every hour.)  It is suggested to start with a low number of steps (like 2 or 4,000) and work your way up (10,000 would be great!) with 6000 being the default.", "developer_id": "570dae8e8bf1c3e35e000007", "header_images": "", "hearts": 68, "id": "57185d8b17981d799d000008", "latest_release": {"id": "57525a8b28295f938000001a", "js_md5": "78925842080cdeab04cf0c158daa2f50", "js_version": -1, "pbw_file": "https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/rbmoNsXQt6NuqPvj23Ew", "published_date": "2016-06-04T04:35:43.755Z", "release_notes": "Fixed a problem with the smaller date.
