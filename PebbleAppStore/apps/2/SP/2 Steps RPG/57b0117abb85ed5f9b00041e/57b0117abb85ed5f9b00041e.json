Although you'll start weak at first, soon you'll grow much more powerful and able to travel much further from home. Many times you'll find yourself going two steps forward then make one step back to safety.\r\n\r\nThe user interface was specifically designed for the Pebble. You travel forward (to the danger) or back (to safety). The game automatically saves when you exit and automatically loads when you open it to continue right where you left off. The select button handles a variety of location specific actions.\r\n\r\nOnce you've won, try again to see if you can do it in fewer moves. Or for a bigger challenge, try focusing on training attack or defense or neither!\r\n\r\nPlease join us on the Pebble Discussion Board for feedback and feature requests. Good luck!", "developer_id": "5430520ca2f62248d600017b", "header_images": "", "hearts": 17, "icon_image": {"28x28": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/F5UWYqpEQqi8V5FCHMXQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28", "48x48": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/F5UWYqpEQqi8V5FCHMXQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"}, "id": "57b0117abb85ed5f9b00041e", "latest_release": {"id": "57b8aff4bb85ed0c85000956", "js_version": -1, "pbw_file": "https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/q6DJXKjRTVGGYqA6Dy2u", "published_date": "2016-08-20T19:34:36.391Z", "release_notes": "- Made change such that \"fight\" automatically repeats attacks until at least you or the enemy receives damage.", "version": "1.1"}, "links": {"add": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57b0117abb85ed5f9b00041e/add", "remove": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57b0117abb85ed5f9b00041e/remove", "add_heart": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57b0117abb85ed5f9b00041e/add_heart", "remove_heart": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57b0117abb85ed5f9b00041e/remove_heart", "add_flag": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57b0117abb85ed5f9b00041e/flags/add", "remove_flag": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57b0117abb85ed5f9b00041e/flags/remove", "share": "https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/57b0117abb85ed5f9b00041e"}, "list_image": {"80x80": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/WWWEYYTUQOOtcqBLr9nM/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80", "144x144": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/WWWEYYTUQOOtcqBLr9nM/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"}, "published_date": "2016-08-14T07:15:58.782Z", "screenshot_hardware": "basalt", "screenshot_images": [{"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/4qyRYKB4QWmQ0SRF6K1r/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}, {"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/h1agSRt6S3qWZ43aXnRh/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}, {"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/jEBmUBkDQxatNu6jfrqo/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}, {"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/8YLdGOjRSz2kbzggSr8d/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}], "source": "", "title": "2 Steps RPG", "type": "watchapp", "uuid": "01c1873a-cca3-4b35-837e-7788f26fdb45", "website": "https://forums.pebble.com/t/watchapp-rpg-investigate-the-growing-threat/22534"}
