New compression warning - will show COMPRESSION? when pebble detects possible compression low\r\n2. Raw values will show between 30-500 (or MMOL equivalent), and show LO and HI outside of those values; raw values outside of those ranges will show ??\r\n3. Timeago change so now will show last actual time received by pebble; timeago will be blank when loading or coming back from any \"pebble outage\" (no bluetooth,check phone, etc), and then will show timeago from last received actual reading on pebble so user can know actual last reading received\r\n4. Time fixes so now time works across time zone changes, dexcom time changes, dexcom time drift issues, daylight savings time changes, future data point problems, xdrip time issues, and any kind of phone time issues (auto update / non auto update, etc).\r\n5.

If raw enabled on pebble endpoint, show calculated raw on face.\r\n3. If raw enabled on pebble endpoint, show noise levels on face. Noise levels displayed - Cln Clean, Lgt Light, Med Medium, Hvy Heavy.\r\n4. If raw enabled on pebble endpoint, in special values (e.g. ???) the last three calculated values will be displayed in the BG field if they exist.\r\n5. If raw enabled on pebble endpoint, watch can vibrate on last calculated raw in special values (e.g. ???). User can set the setting in the configuration file to \"Yes\" or \"No\".\r\n6. User can put \"IOB\" in T1DName in config, and if IOB is enabled on website the IOB value will show up instead of T1DName.\r\n7. Move rig / uploader battery percentage to top half and label as \"Rig\".\r\n8. Show watch battery percentage on face, and switch percentage to CHARGING when plugged in. Label as \"Wch\".\r\n9. Extend RESTRT timeout so that it appears after NO BLUETOOTH timeout, and really only appears when needed.\r\n10. Extend DATA timeout so that it appears after CHECK PHONE timeout, and really only appears when needed.\r\n11. Change RESTRT WCH/PHN message to \u221aAPP/RESTRT, to instruct apple users to open their app, and instruct everyone to restart their watch and phone if necessary.\r\n12. Change DATA OFFLINE message to ATTN: NO DATA to warn users that there is a problem getting data but imply we are still trying to get data and will clear the message when we can.\r\n13. Change CHECK CGM message to CHECK RIG to clarify to the user that they need to check the entire rig, not just the CGM.\r\n14.
