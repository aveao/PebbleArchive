The immediate next train is shown in detail in bold. It is designed to require minimal effort to show important information a rail commuter needs on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nYou can specify your normal home and work railway stations using the configuration page. Only direct rail services are supported - routes with changes won't work.\r\n\r\nRail service data are obtained in real-time using the Huxley web service, which accesses National Rail Enquiries data. The watchface requests your current location from your phone and determines the closest railway station. If you are near your configured home station, you will be shown routes to your work station; otherwise you will be shown routes home. This means that even if you happen to travel away from your normal work station, you may still be presented with a reasonable rail service to get home.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if location is disabled or unavailable, your journeys are still planned using the time of day and your predefined stations.\r\n\r\nUpdates are requested periodically, but can be requested at any time by \"tapping\" (shaking) the watch. When the next train is due to arrive or is slightly late, updates are triggered more frequently. Train times are only fetched during likely commuting times.\r\n\r\nWhere specified in the data, the estimated time of departure (ETD) is displayed. Otherwise, the scheduled time of departure (STD) is shown.\r\n\r\nThe watchface also shows the time and date in a clear and sensible way for UK users.", "developer_id": "556ce3024155355d5b000056", "header_images": "", "hearts": 17, "id": "55de44a8c46b80387c000070", "latest_release": {"id": "56e4ab3481ff03ed9d000032", "js_md5": "508d7fc58ba685f565e12f1e6dbcb52a", "js_version": -1, "pbw_file": "https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/AoaemXdmQgncdZP3701C", "published_date": "2016-03-12T23:50:26.967Z", "release_notes": "Fixed bug relating to train times after midnight.", "version": "1.91"}, "links": {"add": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55de44a8c46b80387c000070/add", "remove": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55de44a8c46b80387c000070/remove", "add_heart": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55de44a8c46b80387c000070/add_heart", "remove_heart": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55de44a8c46b80387c000070/remove_heart", "add_flag": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55de44a8c46b80387c000070/flags/add", "remove_flag": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55de44a8c46b80387c000070/flags/remove", "share": "https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55de44a8c46b80387c000070"}, "list_image": {"80x80": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ayMN9FZHR0GdHwjKV0kQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80", "144x144": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ayMN9FZHR0GdHwjKV0kQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"}, "published_date": "2015-08-26T23:08:40.153Z", "screenshot_hardware": "basalt", "screenshot_images": [{"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ayMN9FZHR0GdHwjKV0kQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}, {"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/tOferOmpSle32IXMezvX/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}, {"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/eblbU9hQYiyK0fXHXO1w/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}, {"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/dMGHUVZtQPSANVm83THr/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}, {"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/NRn894ATQbuHOoN4Be7j/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}], "source": "https://github.com/stevenblair/commuter-bliss-uk", "title": "Commuter Bliss UK", "type": "watchface", "uuid": "79e490a6-6ab7-44db-90a2-e8f2af2452c5", "website": "https://github.com/stevenblair/commuter-bliss-uk"}
