AM/PM denominator for time\r\n- Now pings phone for GPS only every 12 hours at 5am/pm to conserve battery.

Sun rise and set, and moon phase data is calculated on the watch itself. Accuracy is generally within 10 minutes. Compass bearings are calculated as magnetic north until a declination is found, for which Pebble is developing.\r\nPlease be patient with gesture recognition, and try to limit compass usage as it drains battery. The gestures are triggered with repetitious shaking or tapping, for example the options screen is displayed after three shakes within one minute.", "developer_id": "55c95471a29d99642d00002d", "header_images": "", "hearts": 67, "id": "55d1b7047e217af6e4000075", "latest_release": {"id": "56c96db3a79738898a000021", "js_md5": "3044c631d49e68f5e7af53543c52a08d", "js_version": -1, "pbw_file": "https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/gHHXjehzTTqF7JcRDBTj", "published_date": "2016-02-21T07:58:13.579Z", "release_notes": "v2.3 - Build 7 - 2016.02.21\r\n- Added a battery uptime clock, tracks the hours since last charge\r\n- Remove bluetooth icon when phone is connected, now only shows on disconnect\r\n- Vast code improvement to save battery and memory", "version": "2.3"}, "links": {"add": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d1b7047e217af6e4000075/add", "remove": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d1b7047e217af6e4000075/remove", "add_heart": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d1b7047e217af6e4000075/add_heart", "remove_heart": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d1b7047e217af6e4000075/remove_heart", "add_flag": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d1b7047e217af6e4000075/flags/add", "remove_flag": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d1b7047e217af6e4000075/flags/remove", "share": "https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55d1b7047e217af6e4000075"}, "list_image": {"80x80": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/VacNE7BRTQOA17iH8Y0n/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80", "144x144": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/VacNE7BRTQOA17iH8Y0n/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"}, "published_date": "2015-08-17T11:07:58.125Z", "screenshot_hardware": "basalt", "screenshot_images": [{"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/VacNE7BRTQOA17iH8Y0n/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}, {"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/voKbVcQiTXmlb4gGEkim/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}, {"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/L1z7s5pTWWTqwVPWENvV/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}], "source": "https://github.com/kurtlawrence/PebbleWatch_Astronomy_Face", "title": "Astronomy Face", "type": "watchface", "uuid": "6d4b7965-4085-41a7-9b11-fff84e389997", "website": ""}
