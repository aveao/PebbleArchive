This will keep your alarm definitions around but will disable all of them.  Introduced some new screens related to this, just to make it clear when alarms are disabled.  If you do \"show alarms\", they will appear in parentheses to show they're disabled.  If you do \"show next alarm\", it will say they're disabled.\r\n\r\nMade some changes to make sure it clearly displays when an alarm is being pushed out by one or more days, displaying the time and then \"+1\", \"+2\", etc.\r\n\r\nFixed a bug where the program wasn't saving the actual alarm times, so if you restarted the program, it wouldn't remember that an alarm had been pushed out by a day or so.  It now saves this information.\r\n"}, {"version": "1.3", "published_date": "2015-12-12T04:48:25.887Z", "release_notes": "This version should correctly insert and remove timeline pins.
