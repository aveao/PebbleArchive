When it reaches the end, a new column is filled in to indicate a complete minute.\r\n\r\nThere are a few markers to assist with readability. Orange blocks are displayed down the left hand side at every 2 hour increment. The orange horizontal marker represents midday. The black vertical markers are 15 minute increments with the thickest being half past the hour.\r\n\r\nExample: 3 rows are filled. A 4th is partially filled just past the first vertical black line. The time is therefore just gone 3:15am.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it :)", "developer_id": "5575e66ebea9cc922b000050", "header_images": "", "hearts": 11, "id": "558593636b9455d89e0000f0", "latest_release": {"id": "5593ae6e85ea11583400002d", "js_md5": "fd59bbd58c573c196e79f41923a76cd3", "js_version": -1, "pbw_file": "https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/d7p4Dk5FQ72qqjrriN6S", "published_date": "2015-07-01T09:10:21.358Z", "release_notes": "- Added data persistence so that the second hand configuration setting is remembered when the watch face restarts", "version": "1.5"}, "links": {"add": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558593636b9455d89e0000f0/add", "remove": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558593636b9455d89e0000f0/remove", "add_heart": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558593636b9455d89e0000f0/add_heart", "remove_heart": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558593636b9455d89e0000f0/remove_heart", "add_flag": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558593636b9455d89e0000f0/flags/add", "remove_flag": "https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558593636b9455d89e0000f0/flags/remove", "share": "https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/558593636b9455d89e0000f0"}, "list_image": {"80x80": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/FEgJKvEvQaqvTlB7v1mR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80", "144x144": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/FEgJKvEvQaqvTlB7v1mR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"}, "published_date": "2015-06-20T16:39:37.154Z", "screenshot_hardware": "basalt", "screenshot_images": [{"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/FEgJKvEvQaqvTlB7v1mR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}, {"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/S1UoNj3UQ5SM3B2vcDPk/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}, {"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ITgbbvYRp2gYvI6rFvmg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}, {"144x168": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2oqgM3h9T76oTWhZ0ZcQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}], "source": "https://github.com/chrismwaite/equaliser", "title": "Equaliser", "type": "watchface", "uuid": "cb8e1551-1d33-4a80-a840-b0d088721291", "website": "http://www.bytesizeadventures.com/"}
