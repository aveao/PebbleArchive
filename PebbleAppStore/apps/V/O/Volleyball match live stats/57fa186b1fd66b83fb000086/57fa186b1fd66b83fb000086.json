Be always one step ahead the other coachs thanks to the app's live stats. All you have to do is tell the app if you won or lost the last point. The app will automatically compute the winning percentage for every set, at each setter position, when serving or receiving. It will also tell you the percentage your players have when they are in the front row. This way you can notice very quickly which player is having a bad game. At the end of the match you can send the stats to your email address to analyse them later.", "developer_id": "57d40277ffca49333f000168", "header_images": "", "hearts": 2, "icon_image": {"28x28": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/tFFmxsqQEKOWVLqUAfnX/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28", "48x48": "https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/tFFmxsqQEKOWVLqUAfnX/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"}, "id": "57fa186b1fd66b83fb000086", "latest_release": {"id": "57fa31541fd66bfeff000080", "js_md5": "936b1b830b1be6e93a0a09023911d78b", "js_version": -1, "pbw_file": "https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/CkkpK6aDQ7eQ0YyghkGJ", "published_date": "2016-10-09T12:15:11.537Z", "release_notes": "This release includes : -game window with current score and stats when serving( C2: Complex 2), receiving( C1: Complex1) and serving and receiving combined(C1 + C2). - Possibility to pick the team with the serve and your setter position before starting the set. - Check the stats for every set , for every setter position when serving or receiving at anytime. - Check the stats for every set for every player(Setter(Set), middle 3 (M3), middle 6 (M6), opposite (Opp), reception 2 (R2), reception 5 (R5)) when serving or receiving at anytime. - Check the game over stats(for every set combined) for each setter position or for each player when serving or receiving. - Set an email to send stats to. - Send an email with all the stats at the end of the game. - A confirmation screen at the end of every set go to to the next set.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick Manual:\r\nFirst select your setter position and serving team with the select button.\r\nControl in the game window : UP: +1 for your team, DOWN +1 for opponent team, BACK: go back to setter and serving selection, LONG UP: undo last point, SELECT: Go to set stats, LONG DOWN : Go to total game stats, LONG SELECT: reset everything.\r\n\r\nOn the last screen when the game is over you have to input your email(Enter email address) before click on send data.
