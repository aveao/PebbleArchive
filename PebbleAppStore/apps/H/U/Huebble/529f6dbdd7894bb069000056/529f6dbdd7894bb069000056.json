It should actually detect all of your bulbs and let you control them this time. Sorry about that guys. :P - Menu has been reworked to streamline faster light selection and control! - When opening Huebble it is defaulted to controlling every light on your network, once individual bulbs are selected, you can send the highlighted commands to the selected bulb with select, and by doing a long press on select it will send the request to all bulbs! Makes it much easier to quickly control selected and immediately control every bulb! - If a request is submitted and the lights are off, it will turn them on and to what's requested! (e.g. If they're off and you set to 20% brightness, they'll turn on to 20% without you having to manually tell them to turn on first. Very helpful for waking up in the dark!) - Increased speed of menu scrolling. - Now allows you to exit registration screen a the start of the app without registering rather than getting stuck in a loop and requiring a force quit. - KNOWN ISSUE: You will have to reregister the app with your Hue hub once again at the start, and after doing so the lights menu will not detect the name of your bulbs, this is a one time error associated with initial registration that can be resolved by simply exiting Huebble and reentering again. 1.2.2 - Fix for light name detection to work properly. - App now remembers which lights were selected upon exiting. 1.2.3 - Fixed a critical crash caused when no connection to Hub - Updated the \"Send' icon\" 1.2.4 - Cleaned up Javascript - Can now push and hold to control all bulbs for Dance Mode - Added splash screen to help with background loading - Tweaked some icons 1.2.5 - Added an always on backlight"}], "companions": {"ios": null, "android": null}, "compatibility": {"ios": {"supported": true, "min_js_version": 1}, "android": {"supported": true}, "aplite": {"supported": true, "firmware": {"major": 2}}, "basalt": {"supported": true, "firmware": {"major": 3}}, "chalk": {"supported": false, "firmware": {"major": 3}}, "diorite": {"supported": true, "firmware": {"major": 3}}, "emery": {"supported": true, "firmware": {"major": 3}}}, "created_at": "2013-12-04T18:00:29.920Z", "description": "The first true Philips Hue light controlling app for Pebble!
