This is a analogue watchface for Pebble smartwatches that shows the positions of the 24 Hebrew hours, along with a hand to sweep over the watchface once every 24 hours. Thus the first orange dot is sunrise, the first blue dot sunset. As the season changes, the inter-dot distance will grow/shrink, to represent the growing/shrinking Hebrew hours of day and night.\r\n\r\nPebble C originally stolen from initialneil/PebbleFace-IvyTick (GitHub), hacked for this purpose, then heavily refactored. PebbleKit JS originally stolen from NOAA Solar Calculator, lightly refactored.\r\n\r\nI wrote this for my friend Joe (Happy Hanukkah 5776!), and because I think the idea of Hebrew time is really cool and captures seasonal variation in day length well, helping me value my daytime in winter more.\r\n\r\nPublic domain as far as I care.\r\n\r\nVaguely tested in CloudPebble emulator, no guarantees this will actually work for you. :3", "developer_id": "56534f1b28a791aea70000b8", "header_images": "", "hearts": 35, "id": "5663225bfa1c04975d000072", "latest_release": {"id": "566c75aae412bfd4b800004c", "js_md5": "975191a880d96c4e3c8cc0e144e31c60", "js_version": -1, "pbw_file": "https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/YQYJC8ioTxbJtHxhscjQ", "published_date": "2015-12-12T19:30:06.959Z", "release_notes": "Fixed sign error with getTimezoneOffset().
