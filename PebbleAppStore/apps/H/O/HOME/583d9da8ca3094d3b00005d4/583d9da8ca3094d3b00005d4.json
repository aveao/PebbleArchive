Find your perfect seed and never, ever run out of new planet-seed combinations!\r\n\r\nOh, and before I forget, the planet turns every minute, just for the sake of it :D\r\n\r\nIf you really enjoy this face, you can purchase it after the trial ends, which lasts for two full days! To purchase it, simply navigate to the URL provided by your watch. Don't worry, it's the well-known kiezelpay! :D\r\n\r\nHope you find your new HOME! :3", "developer_id": "531b31bd2a95cc1a1b00045c", "header_images": "", "hearts": 7, "id": "583d9da8ca3094d3b00005d4", "latest_release": {"id": "5841e59600355af16100013a", "js_md5": "6b838465bf5cd2da9c63fe9749916f61", "js_version": -1, "pbw_file": "https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Q59c6kwdT1q3nXVnmvhi", "published_date": "2016-12-02T21:20:38.774Z", "release_notes": "You've got settings!
