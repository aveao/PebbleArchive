It couldn't be simpler. \r\nTo control a Mac's audio, long-select on a connected Mac. You'll see an audio control screen, with information about the currently playing track. Long-select again on audio controls to swap between track and volume controls.\r\nTo speed up unlocking even further, if a Mac wakes as you walk up to it using Proximity Wake (enabled in MacID for OS X) while MacID for Pebble is active, you'll get a handy unlock notification in the app. From there you can choose to unlock or snooze requests for an hour, just like MacID for iOS and MacID for Pebble.\r\n\r\nGot feedback?
